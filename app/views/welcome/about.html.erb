        <h2><a name="AboutUs">About Us</a></h2>
          <p>Did you know that many entrepreneurs in the Fashion Industry do not have any formal training/education in business?  For many it’s a passion that they decided to pursue by taking a risk, often learning from experience.  It isn't until entrepreneurs are in the thick of launching their product, collection or brand that they realize they are knee deep in a very complicated world of Business.  At this point, most entrepreneurs cannot commit the time or resources to obtain proper training and often this leads to big, expensive mistakes.  We want entrepreneurs to thrive and for the economy to develop and flourish.  It takes a community to run a business in the Fashion Industry – and we want to support local entrepreneurs by providing a one week program filled with events that will help them connect, launch and accelerate.</p>
          <p>We also recognize that the Fashion Industry is changing.  It’s no longer just about Designers, Manufacturers, Stylists etc.There is also an emerging growth of Fashion-Tech and Wearable Fashion startups globally.  The commonality between all sectors is the need for business skills to survive in this Industry.</p>
          <p>Startup Fashion Week will officially launch in the Fall of 2015 in Toronto!  Why Toronto?  Because there is a plethora of talent, Industry professionals and a vibrant startup community.  It is possible that Startup Fashion Week will take place in different cities across North America afterward to help other Fashion entrepreneurs succeed.  We intend to host various pre-launch events including ‘Startup Fashion Weekend’ to build awareness and media exposure.  To be updated on dates, contests, venue and programming please be sure to sign up for our mailing list HERE (link to mailing list) and follow our social media. (provide links)</p>
